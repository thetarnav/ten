# ten

A small, logical programming language designed for simplicity and ease of use.

Work in progress.

Requires Bun (>=1.3) installed system-wide. Bun is used for package management and testing.

### Scripts:

```sh
bun install                 # Install dependencies (Bun >=1.3)

bun run test                # Run tests
bun run test --watch        # Run tests in watch mode
bun run typecheck           # Check for type errors

./run.ts -i 'true + false'  # Run a ten script from the command line
```

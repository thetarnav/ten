# ten

A small, logical programming language designed for simplicity and ease of use.

Work in progress.

Requires Node and pnpm installed system-wide.

### Scripts:

```sh
pnpm install                # Install dependencies

pnpm test                   # Run tests
pnpm test:watch             # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm typecheck              # Check for type errors

./run.ts -i 'true + false'  # Run a ten script from the command line
```
